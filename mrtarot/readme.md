# Mr. Tarot 

A tool for Tarot cards, definitions, reading resources, spreads, astrological relations, and more!'
I created this as a tool to make my readings faster, more accurate, and easier. Website should be easy to maneuver, and interact with.

# Cards
A list of all 78 Tarot cards, and a summary for both upright and reversed. Clicking a card will bring up more information. (java someday?)

# Definitions 
After clicking a card, user will find more in depth descriptions, definitions, and lore behind each card.

# Reading Resources
Each card will have examples, and situations, in order to help user find more accurate or correlative readings.

# Spreads
Website will have a tab/page filled with different spreads. Useful for unsure readings, or new ideas.

# Astrological Relationship
Certain cards are correlated with an atrological sign. Cards will reflect these signs.

# More 
Want to add a notepad, with selectable buttons (per card) that allow user to identify resonations, and ignore non-applicable information. Improves readings.
Want to add an artificial deck for online readings. (compatible with spreads?)
We will see what I come up with.
